# LDA-Topic-Modelling

Topic Models are a type of statistical model that helps us to uncover hidden structures in a collection of texts. In Topic Modelling, we focus on building clusters of words instead of texts. Hence, we can say that a text is a mixture of all the topics, and each topic has its specific weight.

`Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)` is also called a bag-of-words model, which means that it considers every text as a collection of words, without paying any attention to the grammar or the word sequence. Here a document is considered as a probability distribution of topics, which in turn is a probability distribution of words.

The content for the dataset has been gathered from various news sites, containing the term ‘Monash University’


If you face any issue while importing the pyLDAvis package from gensim, run the below command in the anaconda terminal window (if you are running your jupyter notebook through anaconda):
conda install -c conda-forge pyldavis

The project has been done using python version: 3.8.5
